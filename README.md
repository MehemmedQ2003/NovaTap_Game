# Nova Tap

Nova Tap is a short tap reflex game built with Flutter. Tap the glowing comet as fast as you can inside a tight timer window, watch the target teleport around the board, and try to beat your best streak before the nebula timer collapses.

## Development

- Launch with `flutter run` and pick your device (mobile, desktop, or web).
- The high score is stored while the session is alive; restart the round to reset the clock.
- The assets and launcher icons are already generated through `tool/generate_icons.js` if you want to refresh the branding.
